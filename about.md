I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Social Mind and Body Lab in the Department of Cognitive Science at Central European University, working with [Prof. Natalie Sebanz](https://people.ceu.edu/natalie_sebanz).  I will start a Marie Curie Fellowship in Sep 2020 with [Prof. Natalie Sebanz](https://people.ceu.edu/natalie_sebanz) at the [new CEU location in Vienna](https://www.ceu.edu/article/2019-03-22/central-european-university-announces-new-vienna-campus), and external collaborator [Prof. Stefan Debener](https://uol.de/neuropsychologie/team/prof-dr-stefan-debener) at the [University of Oldenburg (DE)](https://uol.de/). 

I received my PhD in Experimental Psychology from McGill University in 2018, where I worked with [Prof. Caroline Palmer](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/palmer) in the [Sequence Production Laboratory](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/). <br/>

My research broadly addresses how humans synchronize the timing of their actions with external signals, such as tapping along to the beat of music or coordinating tone onset production with a musical partner. I use a combination of behavioural and neural methods to address this question.
