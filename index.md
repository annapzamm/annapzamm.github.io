I am currently a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Cognitive Science Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.ceu.edu/jalproject) in the [Social Mind and Body Lab](https://somby.ceu.edu/) at Central European University Vienna, working with [Prof. Natalie Sebanz](https://people.ceu.edu/natalie_sebanz) and external collaborator [Prof. Stefan Debener](https://uol.de/neuropsychologie/team/prof-dr-stefan-debener) at the [University of Oldenburg (DE)](https://uol.de/). I will start as an Assistant Professor of [Cognitive Science](https://cc.au.dk/en/about-the-school/departments/linguistics-cognitive-science-and-semiotics/) at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) in Fall 2021.

I received my PhD in Experimental Psychology from McGill University (research area: [Cognition & Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/research-0/cognition-cognitive-neuroscience)), where I worked with [Prof. Caroline Palmer](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/palmer) in the [Sequence Production Laboratory](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/). 

My research broadly addresses what factors allow humans to achieve the remarkable feat of synchronizing actions with one another in group behaviours such as ensemble music performance. I use a combination of behavioural and electroencephalography (EEG) methods to uncover processes underlying interpersonal synchrony.
