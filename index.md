I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/). My faculty profile is [here](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/anna-zamm(34046139-7057-4cae-927d-f2458b279026).html).

Before this, I was a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Cognitive Science Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.ceu.edu/jalproject) in the [Social Mind and Body Lab](https://somby.ceu.edu/) at Central European University Vienna. I received my PhD in Experimental Psychology from McGill University (research area: [Cognition & Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/research-0/cognition-cognitive-neuroscience)), where I worked with [Prof. Caroline Palmer](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/palmer) in the [Sequence Production Laboratory](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/). 

My research broadly addresses what factors allow humans to achieve the remarkable feat of synchronizing actions with one another in group behaviours such as ensemble music performance. I use a combination of behavioural and electroencephalography (EEG) methods to uncover processes underlying interpersonal synchrony.
