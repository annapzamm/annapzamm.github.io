Welcome! I am a [tenure-track Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/anna-zamm(34046139-7057-4cae-927d-f2458b279026).html) at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) (AU).

My research takes a [cognitive neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience) approach to investigating how humans synchronize actions with one another in groups, such as when they play music together. I address this question using a combination of behavioural and dual-brain [EEG](Electroencephalography) methods.

Prior to joining AU, I was a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow](https://www.ceu.edu/jalproject) in the [Social Mind and Body Lab](https://somby.ceu.edu/) at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/vienna), and before that I received my PhD in [Psychology](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/) from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) (research area: [Cognition & Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/research-0/cognition-cognitive-neuroscience)).
