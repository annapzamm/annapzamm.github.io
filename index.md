I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Social Mind and Body Lab](https://somby.ceu.edu/) at Central European University, working with [Prof. Natalie Sebanz](https://people.ceu.edu/natalie_sebanz). I received my PhD in Experimental Psychology from McGill University, where I worked with [Prof. Caroline Palmer](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/palmer) in the [Sequence Production Laboratory](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/).

My research broadly addresses what factors allow humans to achieve the remarkable feat of synchronizing actions with one another in group behaviours such as ensemble music performance. I use a combination of behavioural and electroencephalography (EEG) methods to uncover processes underlying interpersonal synchrony. 

In Sep 2020 I will start a [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://www.ceu.edu/jalproject) with [Prof. Natalie Sebanz](https://people.ceu.edu/natalie_sebanz) at the [new CEU location in Vienna](https://www.ceu.edu/article/2019-03-22/central-european-university-announces-new-vienna-campus), and external collaborator [Prof. Stefan Debener](https://uol.de/neuropsychologie/team/prof-dr-stefan-debener) at the [University of Oldenburg (DE)](https://uol.de/).
